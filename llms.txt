Privacy matters but it can be confusing. This page explains our approach to privacy on this website and how it affects you.
SHORT VERSION
 * We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed
 * Some 3rd parties like Facebook and Twitter may know you visited this website, if you use their services. We can’t control them but we don’t believe this knowledge poses any threat to you
 * If you sign up with us we take great care to keep your information safe and we’ll never share it with others without your express permission
 * We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our own services.
These are just the key points. If you need detail, keep reading.
MEASURING OUR VISITORS
We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.
The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.
You can learn more about Google Analytics or opt out if you wish.
FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS
These services provide social buttons and similar features which we use on our website – such as the “Like” and “Tweet” buttons.
To do so we embed code that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friends like this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it.
Social networks therefore could know that you’re viewing this website, if you use their services (that isn’t to say they do, but their policies may change). As our website is remarkably inoffensive we imagine this is not a concern for most users.
EMAILS
We may send you email notifications which you have specifically requested (such as newsletters or updates). You have the ability to opt out of this communication at any time.
We will never provide your personal information or email address to any third parties.
SECURITY
This site takes many precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. These precautions include:
 * Use of SSL encryption for sensitive data
 * Hardware stored in secured data centres behind firewalls
 * All access to information restricted by password and/or secure key
 * Restrictions to what information can be accessed via any location
Whilst we take great care to ensure any confidential information remains protected we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the Internet.
ADDED NAMES
As part of our subscriptions, we offer the chance to add children's names to the website - in either of the Naughty / Nice Lists, or featured in posts. Any names added through the subscriptions are added to areas of the website only accessible to paying members, and as such can only be seen by those who have the appropriate subscription. Names that are publicly available have been generated randomly using this script available on GitHub and should be considered as fake. Any names that appear in the publicly accessible sections of the website that resemble any living or dead human being is purely coincidental and random.

These terms highlight some key facts relating to the subscriptions on The North Pole Times (https://thenorthpoletimes.com) only.
Becoming a paying member (aka. a "subscriber") grants you access to member only sections or pages on the website "The North Pole Times".
There are multiple subscriptions available, based on the number of children who's names you want added to the website. At the time of writing, these subscriptions are aimed at either 1 (one), 2 (two) or 3 (three) children inclusively.
SUBSCRIPTION TIERS
There are two main tiers within the subscriptions, which are as follows:
 1. "Santa's Little Helper"
 2. "Santa's Chief of Staff"
The benefits of each tier are outlined as follows:
"SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER"
This tier grants you the ability to add your child or children's name(s) to either the "Naughty" or "Nice" lists. Member names will be added to the "recent additions" section, which is only available to members - the names above this section were all generated using a simple name generator and should therefore be considered fictitious for the purposes of privacy.
This tier also allows you to request your child or children's name(s) be moved from one list to the other once. For example, if your child or children are behaving in a way that is deemed "naughty", you can request they be added to the "Naughty List", so that when they see their name(s) on the list, they strive to be moved to the "Nice List" through improved behaviour. Subscribers are therefore given the ability to request their child or children's name(s) be moved from one list to the other accordingly. Additional updates will require an upgraded subscription to add an additional child - for example if you have 1 (one) child and move them from the "Naughty List" to the "Nice List" and you want to repeat this process, you would need upgrade to the tier that includes 2 (two) children's names etc.
"SANTA'S CHIEF OF STAFF"
This tier grants you the benefit as shown above in the "Santa's Little Helper" tier, but with the added benefit of being featured in one post on the website too. This will be done in such a way that members can only see the section where their child or children's name(s) have been added, and will ordinarily be hidden to non-subscribers (i.e. public).
REQUESTING NAME(S)
To add the names of your child or children to the website, please ensure you have selected the most appropriate subscription first, then email ghost@thenorthpoletimes.com outlining the name(s) to be added, and to which list (either the "Nice List" or "Naughty List"). If you have chosen the "Santa's Chief of Staff" subscription, name(s) will be added to a post too.
Before any names are added to the website, we will confirm that the appropriate subscription is in place. If not, then no names will be added to the website.
MOVING NAME(S) FROM LIST TO LIST
Should you want to move your child or children's name(s) from one list to the other, then please email ghost@thenorthpoletimes.com with details - please include which list you want to move the name(s) from and to - for example:
> Please move [insert name here] from the Naughty List to the Nice List.
This can only be done once, irrespective of the direction moved.
PAYMENTS
All payments are managed through Stripe. This is subject to their terms and conditions which can be found on their website. The short version is that payment details are encrypted and handled via secure connections.
Subscriptions can be cancelled at any time, and is the responsibility of the user (i.e. you) to manage. This can be done by selecting the floating profile icon button in the bottom right corner of the screen, and selecting "Change" next to your subscription and then finally selecting the "Cancel" option. Once cancelled, your subscription will run until the next billing period (monthly) so you'll retain your member benefits until that time.
REFUNDS
We will happily issue a refund if you contact us via ghost@thenorthpoletimes.com within 1 day of purchase, and on the assumption that no child names have been added to the website. Any refund requests that are sent after names have been added to the website, even if requests for a refund was within the 1-day of purchase window, will be refused on the grounds that the service has already been provided. Refunds are issued via Stripe directly to the payment method used only. There are no other options for a refund other than the above.

Hello there, my festive friends!
Santa here, writing to you from my warm and wonderfully busy North Pole workshop. The elves are hard at work - tinkering, toymaking, and, rather mischievously, humming the Back to the Future theme tune on repeat. Why, you ask? Well… I may be toying with a rather unusual idea this year.
You see, for as long as anyone can remember, my sleigh has been the most reliable ride on (and above) Earth. It’s carried me through blizzards, over mountaintops, across oceans, and once right past a very surprised airline pilot. But lately, while enjoying a quiet evening by the fire with a mug of cocoa and one of my favourite films, a shiny idea has taken hold - whirling through my mind like a tinsel-covered tornado.
What if… just what if… I swapped my sleigh for a flying DeLorean?
Yes, that DeLorean. The one from Back to the Future Part II!
Picture it: gull-wing doors that open like magic, fairy lights twinkling along the sides, candy-cane stripes on the bonnet, and a glowing red nose where the number plate should be. Forget “OUTATIME” - my plate would say “HOHOHO,” obviously.
Ho ho ho! Even Santa’s workshop needs a little help now and then. If you enjoy our updates, a tiny sprinkle of support helps keep The North Pole Times merry and bright for children everywhere.
Now, before you worry, don’t panic - the reindeer haven’t been made redundant. I mentioned the idea over dinner last week, and Rudolph gave me the look. You know the one. Dasher, on the other hand, seemed rather keen - he’s always been the speed enthusiast of the group. And I have to admit, the idea of heated seats, a built-in hot chocolate holder, and Christmas tunes on the stereo instead of howling wind at 30,000 feet? Tempting, very tempting.
But then again, my trusty sleigh runs on pure Christmas spirit. It doesn’t need petrol, batteries, or even a flux capacitor. It’s never broken down, never gotten stuck in traffic, and it’s powered by your belief - and that’s something no engine on Earth can replicate.
So, I’m torn. Should I stick with the faithful sleigh that’s served me for centuries, or take a festive leap into the future in a turbo-charged DeLorean?
What do you think? Write and tell me - I always say the magic of Christmas starts with your imagination. And who knows? Maybe there’s room in the skies for both…
Warm wishes (and warmer cocoa), Santa

Hello there, my little Christmas stars!
Mrs. Claus here, writing to you from my warm, flour-dusted kitchen at the North Pole. The smell of cinnamon biscuits is in the air, the cocoa’s steaming, and the elves are definitely sneaking extra treats when they think I’m not looking. But even with all the baking going on, I’ve got another very important job - helping Santa keep track of the Naughty and Nice Lists.
Ho ho ho! Even Santa’s workshop needs a little help now and then. If you enjoy our updates, a tiny sprinkle of support helps keep The North Pole Times merry and bright for children everywhere.
Each day, Santa and I get updates from our magical Scout Elves who are out and about all over the world. They tell us about kind gestures, good manners, and, occasionally, a few cheeky missteps. But let me tell you a secret: the lists aren’t about being perfect - none of us are! It’s about learning, growing, and choosing kindness, especially when it’s not the easiest option.
Now, the Naughty List doesn’t happen because of one bad moment. It’s for repeated choices - telling fibs, being unkind, or misbehaving when you know better. Just ask Alexander Isak. Santa had to raise an eyebrow when he threw a festive-sized strop over leaving Newcastle United. Oh dear… definitely a few lumps of coal with his name on them! But here’s the good news: the Naughty List isn’t permanent. Say sorry, try harder, and you’ll soon find your name shining on the Nice List again.
Speaking of which, the Nice List is where the real Christmas magic happens. It’s filled with names of those who help, listen, share, and make the world a brighter place. Take Aston Villa’s John McGinn, for example. Not only is he a fantastic footballer, but he turned something tough into something truly special. His famous “goggles” celebration? That’s for his nephew, who was being bullied for wearing glasses. Instead of ignoring it, John made it a symbol of pride and joy. Santa and I were so moved, we gave him a gold star beside his name that very night.
So, my lovelies, just remember: every little choice you make adds a sprinkle of magic to one list or the other. Be kind. Be honest. Help others. Share your toys (yes, even the good ones!). The more joy you spread, the brighter your name shines.
Now, I must dash - those mince pies won’t bake themselves, and the reindeer have very good noses. Keep being wonderful. Santa and I are keeping an eye on things with full hearts and twinkling eyes.
With love and a sprinkle of cinnamon, Mrs. Claus

Hey there, frosty friends!
Rudolph here - yes, the red-nosed one - checking in from the North Pole, where the snow’s fresh, the cocoa’s hot, and the reindeer training field looks suspiciously like an airport built entirely out of candy canes.
Since last Christmas, I’ve been sharpening my navigational skills. You’d think having a glowing nose would make flying a breeze, right? Not quite. Guiding Santa’s sleigh across a changing world takes a bit more than a flashy snout. Cities grow, forests shift, rivers change direction, and even the stars like to play musical chairs on some nights. So I’ve been brushing up with maps, weather charts, and flight routes. Mrs. Claus calls me a “reindeer boffin.” I choose to take that as a compliment.
Santa likes to say we’re basically the London cab drivers of the sky. Except instead of memorising one city, we’ve got to know everything. From the snowy rooftops of Norway to the red-hot dunes of Australia, we need what you humans call “The Knowledge” - just scaled up to global proportions.
 * Dasher’s been revising city layouts
 * Prancer’s brushing up on major landmarks
 * And Vixen? She’s perfecting tight landings for tricky chimney situations. She’s also very proud of her “reverse take-off technique”… we’re not asking.
But it’s not just about knowing where to go - it’s about getting there safely. Fog, snowstorms, gale-force winds… we’ve flown through it all. This year, Santa’s challenged us to be smoother, faster, and more efficient than ever. So each evening, we run practice flights. Picture this: we’re soaring through the skies, dodging imaginary clouds, calling out landmarks - “Big Ben on the left! Eiffel Tower straight ahead!” Great fun. Except Donner insists on yelling, “Are we there yet?” during every single run.
So when you’re curled up in bed on Christmas Eve, just know - we’ve done our prep. The world may keep changing, but with a bit of magic, a whole lot of training, and one slightly overachieving red nose, we’ll get to every home on time. No sat nav required.
And if Santa does get lost? Don’t worry - I’ve got “The Knowledge.”

Hey there, friends! Buddy the Elf here - chief giggler, marshmallow connoisseur, and full-time Christmas cheer champion! Can you believe it? The countdown to Christmas is officially on, and up here at the North Pole, things are going brilliantly… or should I say snowingly?
The workshop is buzzing with elves painting, hammering, and wrapping gifts at full speed—you’d think their candy canes were jet-propelled. Santa’s been starting our mornings with his famous “Jingle Jolt” sessions (he mentioned them last week, remember?), and nothing gets the elf feet moving like some bouncy Christmas tunes. I’ve even been bringing my candy-cane drum to add a little rhythm… although Santa calls my solos “energetic.” I’m still not sure if that’s a compliment or a polite plea to tone it down before I rattle the sleigh off its runners.
Over in Reindeer Training, Rudolph’s been showing off some seriously impressive moves. He’s working on a new flight routine that makes barrel rolls look like gentle snowflake twirls. I asked if I could join in, but apparently elves don’t have wings yet. I’m not giving up hope.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Claus is turning the kitchen into a winter wonderland of smells—mince pies, chocolate chip cookies, and something called “peppermint puff pastry.” I’m convinced it’s made entirely of magic and sugar.
This week, I’m in charge of keeping spirits high, so I’ve been running our daily “Giggle Games” - a friendly competition to see which elf can make the others laugh the hardest. Right now, Twinkle’s in the lead after dressing up as a Christmas pudding and rolling through the workshop shouting, “Dessert incoming!” Absolute legend.
If you want to join the fun from home, try a little cheer-spreading of your own! Sing a carol (yes, out loud), leave a kind note for someone, or build a snowman with the silliest hat you can find. Remember what I always say: “The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear!”
With just a few weeks to go, every smile, laugh, and kind gesture helps keep the magic alive - from your home all the way up here at the North Pole.
So keep smiling, keep singing, and whatever you do… don’t skimp on the marshmallows.
Stay jolly,
Buddy the Elf

Well, would you look at that - it’s already the 5th of December! Hard to believe, isn’t it? Just twenty more sleeps until Christmas, and the buzz up here at the North Pole is enough to power the sleigh on excitement alone.
Now, between you and me, keeping the crew motivated this close to the big day takes a bit more than fairy dust. The elves are working flat out in the workshop, the reindeer are up early each morning training, and Mrs Claus is keeping us all going with her legendary peppermint biscuits. Still, even when we’re knee-deep in wrapping paper and toy parts, keeping the mood merry is absolutely key.
Every morning kicks off with our “Jingle Jolt” meeting. The elves gather, the music starts - usually something upbeat chosen by Buddy the Elf on his candy-cane drum - and we give a big cheer for all the toys completed the day before. You should see their faces light up when their work gets a shoutout. Then, I give them a quick reminder of why we do all this in the first place: to bring joy to children across the world. That little reminder always brings a sparkle to their eyes - brighter than the tree in the town square.
The reindeer? They’re a whole different story. Motivation for them means one thing: healthy competition. They absolutely love their training flights. I’m there on the sidelines, cheering them on as they zip through the frosty skies. Rudolph still leads the pack, but Dasher and Vixen are closing the gap fast this year. We keep it playful with a game we call “Sleigh Tag” -a fast-paced race with extra points for style and teamwork. Honestly, you’ve never seen a happier bunch of flying reindeer.
Once the day winds down, everyone gathers in the Great Hall for hot cocoa, biscuits, and a few stories from Christmases gone by. It’s a little tradition of ours - a reminder that we’re more than a team; we’re a family. And every snow-dusted sleigh ride, toy built, and sparkle of glitter is part of something bigger.
So, that’s our secret to staying motivated: a dash of fun, a heap of heart, and never losing sight of what Christmas really means. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a few toys to check - and maybe, just maybe, room for one more biscuit.

It’s finally here! The 1st of December — the day the North Pole transforms from a cosy winter wonderland into a whirlwind of Christmas cheer! The scent of gingerbread fills the air, the snow sparkles like sugar crystals, and everywhere you look, there’s an elf rushing past with armfuls of toys, tinsel, and to-do lists longer than Santa’s beard.
Inside Santa’s Workshop, the elves are working in perfect harmony — well, mostly! There’s always a bit of cheeky chatter and the occasional snowball flying through the door. Buddy the Elf is testing the toy trains (again), while Tinker and Twizzle are making sure every teddy bear gets its finishing touch — a soft red ribbon tied just so.
Meanwhile, Santa’s deep in his study, checking and double-checking the Naughty and Nice Lists. He’s so focused that he hasn’t even finished his hot chocolate (which tells you just how busy he is!). I’ve been keeping the kitchen ovens glowing all day, baking mince pies and biscuits to keep everyone’s spirits — and energy — up. After all, even the jolliest elf works best after a good snack!
Outside, the reindeer are stretching their legs in the training fields. Rudolph’s nose is shining brighter than ever, lighting the way for the younger reindeer to practise their landings. You should see Dasher and Dancer showing off their new tricks — though I keep reminding them this is Christmas Eve work, not a circus!
By sunset, the whole village twinkles with fairy lights. The sound of laughter echoes from the workshop, and the bells on Santa’s sleigh give a cheerful jingle every time the wind blows. It’s a magical moment — the beginning of our busiest, happiest time of year.
So, as December begins, remember this: while we’re working hard up here in the snow, we’re thinking of you — the children around the world who make Christmas so special. Keep being kind, keep helping others, and keep believing. The countdown to Christmas has truly begun!

Ho, ho, ho! What an incredible Christmas Eve it has been! I’m sitting here, in front of the fireplace, with a big mug of hot cocoa, reflecting on the night’s adventures. We’ve travelled all around the world, delivering presents to boys and girls on the Nice list. The sleigh was packed to the brim, and Rudolph’s nose was shining brightly, guiding us through the cold, snowy skies. I can’t help but smile as I think about all the happy faces we’ll see tomorrow morning when children wake up to their gifts. But for now, it’s time for a rest. The reindeer are enjoying their well-earned carrots, and I’m looking forward to a long winter’s nap before we begin planning for next year. Merry Christmas to all, and to all, a good night!
Mrs Claus:
Well, dear ones, what a night it’s been! I’ve just finished baking a few special treats for Santa and the reindeer, and I can’t help but feel so proud of everyone. From the elves working hard in the workshop to Santa’s flawless journey across the globe, it’s been a Christmas Eve full of love and joy. Now, it’s time for me to take a little rest as well. After all, planning for next Christmas starts early! But for now, I’ll rest and savour the magic of this year’s Christmas. I hope all the children are waking up with big smiles, knowing they were on the Nice list! Merry Christmas, everyone!
Buddy the Elf:
Wow, wow, wow! What a night! It was absolutely magical. I helped pack the sleigh with the best toys, and I was so excited to see Santa zoom off into the night. Now that all the presents are delivered, I’m feeling a bit sleepy (but also really happy). It’s been so much fun seeing all the magic happen, and I can’t wait to start planning the next Christmas adventure. I’ll get some rest now, but just wait till next year—I’ve already got a lot of great ideas for more fun surprises! Merry Christmas to all the boys and girls out there. Ho, ho, ho!
Rudolph:
I have to say, I’m feeling pretty proud of myself tonight! My nose shone so brightly, guiding Santa’s sleigh safely to all the homes, and we did it! We’ve delivered every last present, and the reindeer are now enjoying some well-earned rest. I’ll be taking a nap soon too, as the night has been long, but so full of joy. Christmas Eve is always so special, and it’s an honour to be part of it. I’m looking forward to resting and then getting ready to do it all over again next year. Merry Christmas to everyone—may your hearts be full of cheer!
----------------------------------------
So now, with everything done, we all settle in for a well-deserved rest. The magic of Christmas lives on in our hearts, and we can’t wait to do it all again next year. Merry Christmas to all, and to all, a peaceful night!
Ho ho ho! Even Santa’s workshop needs a little help now and then. If you enjoy our updates, a tiny sprinkle of support helps keep The North Pole Times merry and bright for children everywhere.

Ho, ho, ho! Christmas Eve is finally here, and I can hardly believe it! The elves have been working so hard, and now it’s time for the final touches before I set off on my big journey. I’m busy checking the sleigh, making sure it’s packed with all the wonderful presents for the children on the Nice list. The toys are all wrapped up and ready to go, and there’s plenty of space for those special last-minute gifts that always seem to appear!
First, I double-check the list—yup, I’ve checked it twice, and I’ve made sure that every single child on the Nice list gets something extra special this year. There’s nothing like the joy of seeing the smiles on the children’s faces when they wake up to their presents. It’s the best part of the job, and it’s what makes all the hard work worth it.
Next, I make sure my reindeer are ready. I give each of them a little pat and a word of encouragement. Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen are all excited, but it’s Rudolph who’s especially ready to shine tonight. His nose is glowing bright and strong, and he’s looking forward to guiding us through the night sky. I give him an extra wink and remind him how important his job is, leading us safely to all the homes around the world.
The elves have packed plenty of snacks for the reindeer—carrots, of course, and some special treats for them to nibble on during the trip. And I’ve got a big thermos of hot cocoa for myself! It’s always good to stay warm on a cold Christmas Eve night. There’s nothing like a hot cup of cocoa to keep me going as I make my way around the world delivering presents.
Before I head out, I take a moment to look around the workshop. It’s so quiet now, with everyone asleep, but I can feel the magic in the air. The North Pole feels especially cosy tonight, and I know that all the joy we’ve been spreading all year long is about to come to life in a big way.
So, with everything ready, I climb into the sleigh, give my reindeer the signal, and off we go! The adventure of Christmas Eve is about to begin, and I can’t wait to bring joy to boys and girls all over the world. Merry Christmas to all, and to all, a good night! Ho, ho, ho!

Hi there, my dear friends! It’s Mrs Claus, and today I’m thrilled to share with you some of my most treasured Christmas recipes. I hope you’ll try them at home and enjoy them just like Santa, Rudolph, Buddy the Elf, and the rest of the elves here at the North Pole do. After all, Christmas is a time for love, joy, and of course, delicious treats!
First up, we have my Gingerbread Cookies. These are a big hit with everyone, especially Santa! He loves them because they’re crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I like to decorate them with little icing faces and colourful sprinkles – it makes them look so festive! Santa always asks for extra gingerbread to munch on after his long night of delivering presents. The smell of them baking fills the air, and it makes everyone feel cosy and excited for Christmas Eve.
Next, there’s Candy Cane Cupcakes. These are my special treat that Buddy the Elf loves to help me make. He’s always so enthusiastic (and a bit messy with the sprinkles, I might add!). I bake vanilla cupcakes and top them with a swirl of peppermint frosting. To make them even more fun, I break up candy canes and sprinkle them on top for a minty crunch. The elves say the peppermint gives them the extra “Christmas magic” they need to keep working hard in the toy workshop. I think it just makes them smile, and that’s what counts, right?
Ho ho ho! Even Santa’s workshop needs a little help now and then. If you enjoy our updates, a tiny sprinkle of support helps keep The North Pole Times merry and bright for children everywhere.
Then, of course, there’s Hot Chocolate with Marshmallows. This one’s perfect for warming up after a busy day of preparing for Christmas. Santa loves to sip on it while reading letters from children all over the world. And do you know what the best part is? I always add extra marshmallows, so every sip is like a sweet, fluffy cloud! The elves love a cup too, especially after making toys all day long. It’s a big part of our Christmas cheer here at the North Pole.
So, why does everyone love these recipes so much? Well, it’s because they remind us of all the happy moments we share together during Christmas. Baking treats brings the North Pole to life with laughter and warmth. It’s the little things, like sharing gingerbread cookies or sipping hot chocolate together, that make Christmas so special.
I hope you try these recipes and share them with your family. Just remember, the most important ingredient in any Christmas recipe is a big spoonful of love. Merry Christmas, my sweet little friends!

Oh, how I love Christmas! The lights, the presents, the singing – it’s all so magical. But do you know what I love most? Playing Elf on the Shelf!
That’s right – even we elves play the game! Every December, the elves and I come up with the silliest and most creative ideas for hiding and posing our Elf on the Shelf friends. We think of it as a way to bring a little extra cheer to Christmas time. Would you like to hear about our top 5 ideas? Here we go!
1. CANDY CANE SWING
One of my favourite ideas is setting up a candy cane swing. We hang it on the edge of a shelf, and our elf swings back and forth as if they’re having the time of their life! It’s like a mini playground right in your house.
2. MARSHMALLOW SNOWMAN
Next, we love to create a tiny snowman using marshmallows. We stick them together with icing and give it a little face. Then, our elf sits next to the snowman, as if they’ve just built it. It’s snowy fun indoors!
3. WRAPPING PAPER SURPRISE
For this one, our elf hides inside a roll of wrapping paper. Imagine pulling out some paper to wrap a present, and – surprise! There’s your elf peeking out, all snug and cosy.
4. ELF ZIP LINE
This is a big hit with the reindeer! We string a bit of ribbon from one end of the room to the other and clip our elf to it. The elf looks like they’re zooming across the room. Whoosh! It’s so much fun.
5. HOT CHOCOLATE PARTY
Finally, we set up a tiny hot chocolate party with mini cups, marshmallows, and sprinkles. Our elf sits in the middle, holding a cup as if they’re having a warm drink after a chilly day at the North Pole.
The best part about Elf on the Shelf is the laughter and joy it brings. We elves love to imagine how excited you’ll be when you find your elf in a new spot every morning. Remember, your elf is there to keep an eye on you and report back to Santa. So, keep smiling, be kind, and maybe even share some of your own ideas with your family.
Well, that’s all from me for now! I’ve got to get back to the workshop – the elves and I are planning tomorrow’s Elf on the Shelf surprise. Merry Christmas, and happy hiding!

Ho, ho, ho! Greetings, my little friends! I’m writing to you from my cosy workshop at the North Pole, where the festive magic is in full swing! The elves are hard at work, the reindeer are polishing their hooves, and my sleigh is nearly ready for the big night! I wanted to tell you all about something magical that happens every Christmas Eve – the Santa Tracker!
Now, you might be wondering, “Santa, what’s a Santa Tracker?” Well, let me explain. It’s a clever way for you and your family to follow my journey as I deliver presents to children all around the world. From the moment I leave the North Pole, the tracker shows where I’m flying, which countries I’ve visited, and how many presents I’ve delivered. Isn’t that exciting?
Ho ho ho! Even Santa’s workshop needs a little help now and then. If you enjoy our updates, a tiny sprinkle of support helps keep The North Pole Times merry and bright for children everywhere.
Every year, as the clock strikes midnight on Christmas Eve, my reindeer and I take off into the starry sky. First, we fly over snowy rooftops, then across glittering cities, and even above warm beaches! With the Santa Tracker, you can see exactly where we are. You might spot me zooming past your house if you’re quick!
The elves love the Santa Tracker too. They keep an eye on it back at the North Pole to make sure everything is going smoothly. Buddy the Elf always giggles when he sees me flying over a volcano or a jungle – he says it’s not what you’d expect for a sleigh ride!
But do you know the best part about the Santa Tracker? It reminds you to go to bed early. That’s because I can’t deliver presents if you’re still awake. So, when you see I’m getting close to your town, it’s time to snuggle under the covers and close your eyes tight.
Oh, and don’t forget to leave out some treats for me and the reindeer. I do love a mince pie and a glass of milk, and the reindeer would be delighted with a carrot or two.
So, my dear friends, when Christmas Eve arrives, gather your family around the Santa Tracker, and let’s share the magic of Christmas together. Remember, I’ll be checking my Nice List as I go – so be kind, be helpful, and keep those big smiles on your faces.
Merry Christmas to you all, and ho, ho, ho!

Hello there, friends! It’s me, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. You’ve probably heard of me – I’m the one with the shiny, bright red nose. Santa always says it’s as shiny as a Christmas bauble, and it’s what helps me guide his sleigh on foggy nights. Would you like to hear about what I’ve been up to at the North Pole? Let me tell you all about it!
First of all, things at the North Pole are buzzing! Every elf and reindeer is working hard to make sure everything is ready for Christmas. My friends at the North Pole are always looking for exciting stories, and this year they even wrote about my training! I felt like a proper celebrity.
Speaking of training, did you know that guiding Santa’s sleigh isn’t just about flying fast? It’s a very important job, especially when there’s fog or snowstorms. My shiny nose helps light the way so we don’t miss any houses. That’s why the elves call it the “Rudolph's Sleigh Guidance system.” Pretty clever, don’t you think?
When I’m not training, I love popping into the workshop to see what the elves are up to. They’re absolute geniuses when it comes to making toys. Last week, Buddy the Elf showed me how they build toy cars. It’s top-secret, though, so I can’t tell you too much. But I can say this: the elves have the best toy-making secrets, and they’re always inventing new, exciting toys for children like you.
Now, I know many of you are wondering about Santa’s famous Nice List. It’s true – Santa checks it twice! He tells me it’s very important to be kind, listen to your parents, and help your friends. He sees everything you do, and I promise you, he’s always looking for reasons to put names on the Nice List. So, keep being your best self, okay?
Finally, the Christmas preparations at the North Pole are in full swing. The big tree in the square is covered in sparkling lights, the workshop is bustling, and Santa is double-checking his maps. Everyone has a job to do, and it’s all so magical.
Well, I’d better dash! The reindeer team and I have another practice flight soon, and I’ve got to shine my nose. Remember, keep being kind, stay on the Nice List, and always believe in the magic of Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you and your family!

Ho ho ho! Santa here, with a warm mug of cocoa and a smile as I think back on the past few Christmases. One of my favourite things about the holiday season is seeing the Popular Christmas Toys that everyone gets so excited about. Thanks to my friends at The North Pole Times, I always know what’s trending. So, let’s take a little stroll down memory lane, shall we?
1. THE FIDGET CRAZE
A few years ago, there was a fidgeting frenzy, with spinners everywhere! Kids loved these clever little gadgets that kept their fingers busy and helped them stay focused. I must admit, I tried one myself (though I’m better at making toys than spinning them!). These toys certainly earned their place on Santa's Nice List — fun and practical!
2. COLLECTIBLE TOYS
Next, we saw the rise of collectible toys like LOL Surprise! dolls and Hatchimals. There’s something magical about finding a little surprise inside a toy, and children couldn’t wait to see what they would get. It was wonderful to watch kids swap and trade their treasures, and it’s no surprise these made the Nice List!
3. INTERACTIVE & TECH TOYS
The last few years have also brought a surge in tech toys — from smart robots to interactive pets. These clever gadgets have made a big impact, with children enjoying all the tricks and features they can control. Even I was amazed by how advanced some of these toys are! And yes, they all made it to Santa's Nice List.
4. CLASSIC TOYS THAT NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE
Of course, some toys never lose their magic. LEGO sets, board games, and stuffed animals are still as loved as ever. Whether you’re building a castle or playing with a cuddly friend, these timeless toys will always be a hit at Christmas. And they’re always on the Nice List!
As we look forward to the next Christmas season, I can’t wait to see what new toys will capture your imagination. No matter what’s popular, the true magic of Christmas lies in giving and sharing joy — and that’s what makes it all special.
Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a wonderful toy-filled year!

Hello, children! I’m Mrs Claus, and today I want to share a little secret with you. You probably already know about my wonderful husband, Santa Claus—jolly, kind, and always busy getting ready for Christmas. But did you know that I help him with something very important? That’s right—I help keep track of the Naughty and Nice Lists! Let me tell you how I do it, and maybe you’ll get some tips on how to stay on the Nice List too!
WHO AM I?
Well, I’m Mrs Claus, and I live here at the North Pole with Santa and all the elves. Some people think I spend all my time baking biscuits or making toys, but that’s not all I do! I’m also in charge of making sure that everyone—especially the children—are being kind and thoughtful all year round. Santa can be very busy delivering gifts, so I help him keep track of who’s been good!
HOW I KEEP TRACK OF THE NAUGHTY AND NICE LISTS
I have a very special, magical book that helps me. This book isn’t just a regular book—oh no! It has the names of every child in the world, and it’s filled with all sorts of magical notes. When someone does something kind—like helping a friend, saying “thank you,” or being polite to their parents—I write it down in my book. But if a child forgets to be nice, the book gives me a gentle reminder to help them be better next time. I believe everyone can learn and grow!
I also have help from the elves. Some of them are very good at keeping an eye out for good behaviour, and they send me updates about which children are being extra kind. That way, Santa and I know exactly who should be on the Nice List!
MY MAGICAL HELPERS
I’m not alone in this job—oh no! I have some magical helpers. The elves are always busy making toys, but a few of them help me by watching for kindness. There are even magical snowflakes that swirl around my book, showing me the best moments of kindness that happen all around the world. So, when you help your friend or give a hug to someone who’s sad, those snowflakes might just be watching!
MY ADVICE FOR STAYING ON THE NICE LIST
Now, you might be wondering, “Mrs Claus, how can I stay on the Nice List?” Well, it’s very simple! The best way to stay on the Nice List is by being kind every day. It’s not about being perfect, because no one is perfect. But if you try your best to be kind—whether it’s helping your family, being nice to your friends, or just using your best manners—you’ll definitely make it to the Nice List! And if you ever make a mistake, don’t worry! You can always make up for it by doing something kind the next day.
HOW DO I STAY ON SANTA'S NICE LIST?
So, remember this: every time you do something nice, I’m taking note in my magical book. If you try your best to be kind and caring, you’ll always be on the Nice List in my heart. And you’ll help make the world a little brighter, just like Christmas lights!

Seasons greetings. It's Buddy the Elf, here to share a little secret about how we make all those toys for Christmas. It's a big job, but it's a whole lot of fun.
First, we listen. We listen to the wind, the birds, and even the trees. We listen to the kids, the parents, and even the grumpy old folks. They whisper secrets about what toys are cool, what's not so cool, and what every kid wants most.
Then, we do some elf magic. We count and calculate, and we use a special kind of maths that only elves understand. We figure out how many kids there are in the whole world, and how many toys each one might want. It's a lot of numbers, but it's fun elf maths!
Our reindeer friends are super helpful too. They fly all over the world, checking on every kid and every house. They let us know if there are any new little ones who need toys.
And of course, there's Mrs. Claus, the queen of cookies and kindness. She knows everything about everyone, and she helps us keep track of who's been naughty and who's been nice.
But the most important thing is the Christmas spirit. We make toys with love and care, and we hope they bring joy to every child.
So, the next time you see a toy under the tree, remember the elves who made it with love. And remember, we're always listening to your wishes.

- URL: https://thenorthpoletimes.com/how-rudolph-guides-the-sleigh/

Hi there! It’s Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer. You’ve probably heard how my shiny nose leads Santa’s sleigh on Christmas Eve, but there’s much more to it. Today, I’ll reveal how I plan the route, train the team, and answer the question: can reindeer fly? Here’s how Santa’s reindeer find their way and get ready for the big night.
HOW SANTA’S REINDEER FIND THEIR WAY
Leading the sleigh takes more than just a glowing nose. My nose isn’t just a light; it interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field, helping me chart the safest and fastest route. It’s like having a built-in compass and radar system.
Santa and I also plan in advance. We combine celestial navigation (stars are great guides!) with advanced GPS to map out our journey. This preparation ensures that even if we face blizzards or unexpected obstacles, we can stay on track and deliver every gift on time.
CAN REINDEER FLY?
Yes, Santa’s reindeer can fly—but it’s not something all reindeer can do. Our ability to soar through the skies comes from a special magical dust created by Mrs. Claus. Combined with rigorous training, it gives us the power to take off and stay airborne.
Flying isn’t just about magic, though—it’s also about fitness. Every year, the reindeer team trains to ensure they’re fast, efficient, and silent. I help lead these sessions, especially focusing on night flying, teaching younger reindeer how to manoeuvre in low visibility and follow my light.
HOW RUDOLPH GUIDES THE SLEIGH ON CHRISTMAS EVE
On Christmas Eve, my job is to lead the sleigh safely around the globe. My glowing nose lights the way through storms and darkness, while I steer the team to avoid obstacles like tall buildings or bad weather.
Before we take off, I run a pre-flight check to ensure the sleigh is balanced, everyone is harnessed correctly, and my nose is glowing at full power. Once in the air, I stay alert to adjust the route as needed. Communication with Santa is essential; together, we navigate any surprises that come our way.
My fellow reindeer rely on me to set the pace and make quick decisions. By mid-flight, we’re a perfectly coordinated team, delivering gifts with precision and speed.
TRAINING SANTA’S REINDEER
Preparation for Christmas Eve is a year-round effort. I help train the team to fly faster, longer, and quieter.
Our training includes:
• Endurance Runs: Simulating the long distances we’ll cover on Christmas Eve.
• Stealth Flying: Practicing silent gliding so we don’t wake sleeping children.
• Teamwork Drills: Strengthening coordination to ensure we stay in formation.
These sessions not only build strength but also foster trust, which is key when flying as a team.
A CHRISTMAS EVE TO REMEMBER
So, how Santa’s reindeer find their way and deliver joy worldwide? It’s a combination of preparation, teamwork, and a little magic. Leading the sleigh is an honor, and every year, I’m proud to guide the team through the skies.
This Christmas Eve, as you look up, know that it’s not just magic guiding the sleigh—it’s training, trust, and my glowing red nose lighting the way. Merry Christmas to all!
— Rudolph

Well, ho ho ho! November's here, and let me tell you, it's a whirlwind of activity up here at the North Pole. It’s the time when the real magic begins to stir.
The elves are already hard at work, their tiny hands crafting toys of all shapes and sizes. From teddy bears soft as clouds to sleek, high-tech gadgets, they're making sure every wish list is filled to the brim. The workshop is a symphony of hammering, sawing, and joyful chatter.
I've been busy too, checking the naughty and nice list. It's a big job, you know, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world. I love seeing all the names, old and new, and imagining the smiles on their faces on Christmas morning.
Rudolph and the other reindeer are getting ready for their big night, too. We’ve been practicing our flight paths and making sure everyone’s in top form. Rudolph's nose is shining brighter than ever, ready to guide us through the darkest night.
Of course, no Christmas would be complete without a feast. Mrs. Claus is already busy baking cookies, cakes, and all sorts of delicious treats. The smell of gingerbread fills the air, making it even harder to resist a little taste.
So, as you can see, November is a crucial month for us here at the North Pole. We're working hard to make sure Christmas is the most magical time of the year. I can’t wait to see all the happy faces on Christmas morning.

Hello my dear friends!
Oh, the joy and excitement in the North Pole is just as bright as my red nose! Can you believe it? There are only three sleeps left until Christmas Day, and everyone is buzzing with cheer!
Santa is checking his list not once, not twice, but thrice! He wants to make sure every good little girl and boy gets just what they wished for. His belly jiggles like a bowl full of jelly, and his 'ho ho ho' echoes through the workshop.
Buddy the Elf is running around with more energy than ever, and that's saying something! He's wrapping presents faster than you can say "candy cane," and he even challenged me to a snowball fight! Of course, I had to let him win – after all, he's got that elf magic.
Mrs Claus is in her kitchen, baking up a storm. The sweet smell of gingerbread and cinnamon fills the air. She's making sure Santa has enough energy for his big journey, and she promised to leave out an extra special treat for him this year.
The reindeer gang and I are practicing our takeoff and landing, making sure we're in tip-top shape for the big night. It's so much fun swooshing through the snowy sky, and my red nose is shining extra bright with excitement.
All around the North Pole, the elves are singing carols and decorating the trees. The snowmen are giving us a friendly wave, and the polar bears are doing their best dance moves. It's a winter wonderland, and we can hardly wait for the magic of Christmas to spread around the world.
So, my little pals, get ready for the most wonderful time of the year! Santa and his team are gearing up for a sleigh ride like no other, and we can't wait to bring joy and happiness to you all.
Merry Christmas to each and every one of you!

Hey there, little friends! Gather round for a jolly tale from the North Pole, where snowflakes are sweeter than candy, and every day feels like a Christmas party. I'm Buddy, and I've got a story that'll make your sugarplum dreams even sweeter!
So, once upon a snowy day, I was busy making a gingerbread house in Santa's workshop when I saw a cheeky little mouse having a grand old time. Instead of getting all grumpy, I had a sparkly idea! I thought, "Why not have a tiny friend to keep an eye on kids and share their good deeds with Santa?"
I grabbed some magical snowflakes, sprinkled them over a cuddly elf toy, and with a twinkle in my eye, I whispered a super-duper magical spell. Ta-da! That's how the very first Elf on the Shelf, Jingles, came to life. I called him Jingles because he made the happiest jingling sounds as he zoomed around.
Now, Jingles had a special job – to watch over you and your friends and give Santa the lowdown on all the good stuff you do. Each night, Jingles flew back to the North Pole and spilled the cocoa beans on your kindness and good deeds. And when you woke up, guess where he was? In a new spot, of course, with a mischievous grin!
The word got out about Jingles and his magical adventures, and soon, there were lots of scout elves spreading cheer all over the world. Families welcomed them with open arms, and kids like you had a blast finding their scout elf's sneaky new hiding spot every morning.
So, thanks to a little bit of creativity and a whole lot of Christmas spirit, the tradition of Elf on the Shelf was born, making every Christmas sparkle with extra enchantment for kids everywhere.

Hello, my dear friends!
Christmas is nearly here, and I am so excited to share the true magic behind this special day. Gather round and let me tell you about the real meaning of Christmas!
Christmas is more than just twinkling lights, snowy rooftops, and Santa's sleigh. It's about love, kindness, and the joy that comes from giving. Imagine Christmas as a gigantic cuddle that wraps around the whole world, bringing warmth and happiness to everyone.
Now, let's talk about giving! It's not just about the presents under the tree, but the smiles we share and the laughter that fills the air. When you give a helping hand, share a toy, or give someone a big, heartfelt hug, you're spreading the true magic of Christmas.
Think of Christmas as a giant, sparkly snowflake made up of family and friends. It's a time when we come together, make memories, and appreciate the people around us. You see, the real magic happens when we show love and care for one another.
Santa and I, we love to see your happy faces on Christmas morning. But, more importantly, we love to see you being kind, caring, and sharing the joy with those around you. That's the secret recipe for a truly magical Christmas!
So, this Christmas, remember to be kind, share your love, and make wonderful memories with your family and friends. That's the true meaning of Christmas, my dear little ones.
Wishing you all a holly-jolly Christmas full of love, laughter, and the warmest of hugs!

I've got some secrets to share with you about how I decide who's on the Naughty and Nice lists. Are you excited? I know I am!
Now, you see, my marvellous elves and I are always watching over everyone throughout the year. We have a magical way of keeping an eye on all the boys and girls around the world. We pay attention to the kindness and good deeds that warm our hearts.
Firstly, being kind to others is very important. If you share your toys, help your friends, and listen to your parents and teachers, that's a big thumbs up! It's like sprinkling a little extra Christmas magic on your name or achieving a Class DoJo point!
But, if you're not so nice and you end up on the Naughty list, don't worry too much. We all make mistakes, and there's always time to make things right. Apologising and trying to be better is the best way to get back on the Nice list, so if you have been naughty recently, why not go and apologise and make up for it now?
Another thing I look for is how you treat your pets. Being gentle and loving towards animals is a sure way to land on the Nice list. Remember, Rudolph and his reindeer pals are part of my extended family, and they love kindness just as much as I do!
Now, here's the biggest secret of all – the power of saying 'please' and 'thank you.' Manners make everything merrier! When you use those magic words, it puts a big smile on my face, and you'll find your name shining brightly on the Nice list.
So, my dear little ones, keep spreading joy, kindness, and a sprinkle of magic wherever you go. Santa and his team are always cheering you on, and we can't wait to deliver the most wonderful gifts to all the good boys and girls on Christmas Eve. Merry Christmas to you all!

You know, every year, Santa and I work together to plan the most magical route to deliver presents to all the children around the world.
First things first, we gather at the North Pole with the whole reindeer crew – that's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen, and, of course, me with my shiny red nose! Once we've trained in the build up to the big day, we huddle together in Santa's cozy workshop, sipping on hot chocolate and nibbling on carrots, while Santa gets out his big map.
Santa and his team of elves have been working very hard to create a special route that takes us to every house, bungalow, flat and apartment block. It's like a super-duper magical treasure map, and we need to make sure we don't miss anyone!
We start by checking the weather, making sure it's just right for a smooth sleigh ride. Santa's weather elves give us the scoop on snowfall, wind direction, and temperature – we wouldn't want Santa to catch a cold, would we?
Then, we look at the time zones around the world. Since not everyone celebrates Christmas at the same time, we need to be careful with our timing. Santa's special watch helps us keep track so we can deliver presents at just the right moment.
As we plan, the elves help us load up the sleigh with presents, making sure we have something special for everyone. It's like a giant game of present Tetris, and the elves are the masters!
Once everything's set, Santa gives us a jolly thumbs up, and off we go, zooming across the starry sky. With my glowing red nose leading the way, we follow our magical map, spreading joy and cheer to children far and near.
So, my little friends, on Christmas Eve, when you hear the jingle of bells and the patter of reindeer hooves on your roof, know that Santa and I have carefully planned our route just for you. Wishing you the merriest Christmas ever!

Hello, little elves and dear friends! It's your jolly friend Mrs. Claus here, and I'm bursting with excitement because something magical is happening in Santa's Workshop at the North Pole – we're decorating for Christmas!
Picture this: the elves are buzzing around like busy bees, putting on their tiniest hats and tiniest shoes to make our workshop look as festive as can be. We've got gingerbread baking in the oven and twinkling lights that sparkle like the snow outside.
Now, you might be wondering, why do we decorate? Well, it's simple! Decorating the workshop brings joy and cheer to everyone working hard to make toys for all the good boys and girls around the world. When the workshop is filled with Christmas spirit, the toys seem to come to life with extra magic!
This year, we have a special team of elves in charge of creating giant paper snowflakes. They carefully cut and fold each snowflake, making sure they're as unique as the real ones falling outside. We tape them to the walls, and suddenly, our workshop is transformed into a winter wonderland!
And what's Christmas without a tree? Oh, the biggest, most splendid tree you've ever seen stands proudly in the centre of our workshop. The elves and I decorate it with baubles, tinsel, and even tiny toy trains that go 'round and 'round. It's a sight to behold!
So, as we deck the halls and put the final touches on our festive workshop, we're sending our warmest wishes to all the boys and girls eagerly waiting for Santa's visit. May your Christmas be merry and bright, just like our workshop here at the North Pole!
Wishing you giggles and joy,
Mrs. Claus

Hey kiddos! Guess who's chatting with you? Yep, it's Buddy the Elf, one of Santa's little helpers and I'm spilling the beans on how we get ready for Christmas up here in the North Pole!
First off, picture this: elves in sparkly hats and pointy shoes. We make sure we're looking sharp – a happy elf is a snazzy elf, you know!
Now, onto the fun stuff – making toys! We've got piles of blocks, teddy bears, and dolls just waiting for some elf magic. Santa's list is like our treasure map, guiding us to turn wishes into real-life presents. It's like being toy-making wizards!
And then there are the reindeer – Rudolph and his gang. We give them the VIP treatment – antler polish, hoof trims, and lots of stories to keep them in high spirits. Gotta make sure they're ready for the big night!
Now, the best part – wrapping presents! We dive into a sea of colourful paper, ribbons, and bows. It's like a present-wrapping (gift-wrapping to our American friends) party, and we make each one as special on the outside as it is inside.
As Christmas Eve creeps closer, we gather in the courtyard, sing carols, and get really excited for the big night. We also help Santa update the Nice and Naughty lists, mostly by popping in and visiting your homes in the build up to Christmas - you won't see us though, as we are experts at staying hidden! Then, with a twinkle in Santa's eye and a booming "Ho, ho, ho!" off we go, spreading joy to kids all over the globe.
So, little sprouts, when you unwrap that amazing present on Christmas morning, know it's made with elfin love and delivered with heaps of Christmas cheer. Merry Christmas, and may your days be super merry and full of fun!

Ho, ho, ho, dear little ones!
It's Santa here, and I'm so excited to share a special sneak peek into all the North Pole magic as we get ready for Christmas 2023! So, grab a hot chocolate, get all snuggly, and let me spill the beans from my magical diary...
In Santa's Workshop, my super-duper elves are working like busy bees, making toys with so much love and care. The air is filled with the fantastic aroma of gingerbread biscuits– you know, the ones that make your tummy do a happy dance. And oh, my reindeer friends can't wait to dash through the snowy skies on Christmas Eve!
You'll find out all the cool stuff happening behind the scenes. We check the Naughty and Nice lists to make sure everything's just right, and we even test the sleigh to make sure it's super tip-top condition, just like we do every year.
As the days fly by, the excitement is off the charts! I love reading letters from children all around the world – your hopes and dreams warm my heart. The workshop is like a big playground of ideas, with my elves inventing new toys that will bring big smiles to your faces.
Stay tuned for more updates as we get closer to the big day! The North Pole is buzzing with excitement, and together, we're going to make this Christmas the best one ever!
Sending you merry wishes,
Santa Claus

I'm so excited! The big day, Christmas Day to be specific, is almost here! Me and the rest of the Elves have been so excited, we have been unable to sleep.
It's been super busy in Santa's Workshop over the last few weeks, as we busily prepare all the presents for all the boys and girls on The Nice List, making sure all those toys are labelled easily for Santa to deliver.
I've also overheard Santa and Mrs Claus discuss their final revisions to The Nice and Naughty Lists, making sure they know exactly who is on there when Santa heads off on his journey. If you keep reading, I'll drop a few names on here of who has been put on The Nice List after hearing what Santa and Mrs Claus said!
So, if you're reading this and you're still on The Naughty List, then you have two more sleeps to be as nice as possible before Santa heads off to deliver his presents.

PSST! Want to know who's definitely on The Nice List? Here are a few names of boys and girls who are on there...
A
Adlington, Rosy
Ambrose, Charlie
Ancastser, Olivia
Archer, Teddy
Archer, Thomas
Askew, Maisy
B
Ball, Alicia
Bell, Noah
Bolton, Peter
Bull, Hayley

Ok, I've said too much already! You'll need to keep being good to be sure to be on The Nice List for Christmas Day!

Delivering presents to nearly 2 billion children who are on The Nice List across the world is very tiring work! Keeping the energy levels of Santa, the reindeer and the team of elves up is also a challenging task, but one that thankfully has been made easier thanks to the generosity of all the girls and boys Santa visits every year, who often leave out snacks before they go to bed on Christmas Eve.
But just what foods does Santa and the team like?
SANTA LOVES MINCE PIES
Think of Christmas and you'll probably think of mince pies - those tasty cakes filled with mixed fruit, spices and other goodies - and one of Santa's favourites! But have you ever tried eating 3 mince pies? 10? 100? How about 2 billion?! Now, Santa really does appreciate every mince pie left out by the Christmas tree by every single one of you, but eating that many mince pies is a challenge in itself!
SANTA LOVES OTHER FESTIVE TREATS
Every year, once Santa returns from his grand delivery, he often mentions how he loves other festive bites that have been left out for him - these are some of his favourites:
 * Stollen - a fruit bread filled with nuts, spices, marzipan, powdered sugar and whole lot more ("What is Stollen?")
 * Lebkuchen - similar to stollen, but tastes more gingery and biscuit sized for convenience ("What is Lebkuchen?")
 * Yule log - a chocolate covered Swiss role that resembles a branch of a tree
 * Gingerbread people - delicious biscuits spiced with ginger, cinnamon and other festive spices that is often cut into a variety of shapes such as people, Christmas trees and anything else you can think of!
 * Marzipan - an almond flavoured confectionary that is often shaped like fruits, or added as a layer inside cakes ("What is Marzipan?")
So Santa pretty much loves anything festive and convenient on his travels!
DOES SANTA LIKE A DRINK TOO?
When you travel almost 100 million miles around the world in a single night, it's not surprising that you tend to get thirsty! Again, Santa is absolutely amazed by how many boys and girls leave him a drink when he drops by! Here are some of Santa's favourites:
 * Water - nothing refreshes you as much as a glass of fresh water
 * Brandy - travelling in the middle of the night is cold work! A little sip of brandy often helps keep Santa warm on his journey
 * Beer - another refreshingly tasty favourite that Santa often loves
 * Whisky - often left by girls and boys in Scotland, Ireland, some parts of England and Japan, Santa enjoys this luxurious treat whenever a "wee dram" is left out for him
 * Milk - a great alternative if Santa is feeling a bit full from his snacks, but fancies a little drink
WHAT ABOUT RUDOLPH AND THE ELVES?
Reindeer are simple, yet majestic animals and they love a nice, crunchy carrot. Not only does this orange vegetable perk them up, it also provides a great source of vitamin A that helps Rudolph and his team of trusty reindeer see just that little bit better in the middle of the night!
Elves are definitely creatures with a sweet tooth - they absolutely love anything sweet and sugary! Chocolate coins? Yep! Candy canes? You bet! Gum drops? Most certainly! If it is sugary and sweet, then you can guarantee that the Elves will love them!
SANTA, THE REINDEER AND THE ELVES JUST APPRECIATE ANYTHING LEFT OUT FOR THEM
At the end of the day, Santa and his team of reindeer and elves just appreciate anything they are treated to when they visit on Christmas Eve, so whatever you leave out, they'll be grateful!
That reminds me, I must renew Santa's gym membership as he'll most certainly need to hit that treadmill soon!

A lot of boys and girls (and Mummy's and Daddy's) wonder how I, Santa, manage to visit so many different places, like garden centres, shopping centres, outdoor wonderlands and more in the build up to Christmas. Well, the easiest answer is that I'm Santa and I have magical abilities to do things that your every day people cannot.
You see, whilst Christmas Eve is my busiest day of the year, I also spend the rest of the time working on festive magic to ensure I have enough to meet as many boys and girls as possible in the build up to Christmas. After all, I still need to check whether the girls and boys I meet are on The Nice List or The Naughty List!
Yesterday, I was busy meeting boys and girls at The Bullring in Birmingham, and the day before that I was at Meadowhall near Sheffield and it was fantastic meeting all the girls and boys and hearing all about what they would like for Christmas.
Today, I'm going to be at Denby Pottery in Derbyshire and I cannot wait to meet all the boys and girls who have booked a time to meet me. I really hope that everybody is excited and behaves themselves so I can be sure to put them on The Nice List ready for Christmas Eve!
Only 8 more sleeps until Christmas Day, so be on your best behaviour boys and girls!

Every year, Buddy The Elf reports back that most asked question by children he and the Elves visit in the build up to Christmas is "how does Santa get in our home?"
It's a valid question and one that seems to puzzle most children, and some parents!
HOW DOES SANTA GET INTO YOUR HOME TO DELIVER YOUR PRESENTS?
In the days before central heating, most houses had an open fire and as a result, a chimney. Chimneys were extremely helpful to Santa, as he could slip down them in the night (once the fire was out of course), and drop right into the living rooms of all the boys and girls around the world with ease. However, since fewer people use an open fire now, and have fewer chimneys in their houses, Santa has had to come up with a few new tricks to get inside to deliver all your presents.
SANTA HAS A MAGIC KEY
That's right, Santa has a magic key that works in every lock ever made! Not only does this allow Santa to come in to deliver your presents on Christmas Eve, it also does so silently, so it won't wake anybody in the house.
SANTA HAS ELVES THAT HELP HIM
Elves are magical little creatures. Not only do they love making toys, eating sugary sweets, cakes and chocolates, but they are fantastically quick and nimble! Elves are also a whole lot smaller than Santa, so can easily squeeze through the tiniest of gaps, so they can then let Santa in once they get inside. Buddy the Elf once told me he managed to slip through a letter box, tip-toe past a sleeping doggie, and through the kitchen to the back door to let Santa in, all without making a sound!
SANTA STILL USES CHIMNEYS IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE
Chimneys are still around, as many houses have log burners or stoves, so if your home has once of these, then Santa will always try and use the chimney wherever he can!
THAT'S HOW SANTA GETS IN YOUR HOME!
So there you are, Santa is determined to never let any boy or girl go without a present (assuming they are on The Nice List, and definitely not on The Naughty List!), so has many tricks up his red velvet sleeves!

With less than 15 days left until Christmas Day, there has been lots of activity from the Elves who have been busy keeping an eye on all the girls and boys around the world and keeping them on the Nice or Naughty list depending on how they've been behaving recently.
Whilst Santa does try and watch over as many boys and girls as he can, he's a very busy man and is currently planning his journey to make his deliveries on Christmas Eve, so he's been relying on the Elves to provide him with updates.
There have been quite a few changes as a result of the most recent update, with a number of girls and boys being moved onto the Naughty List... Here are some of the reasons why these boys and girls were moved:
1. NOT LISTENING TO THEIR MUMMY OR DADDY
Around 66% of those who had to be put (hopefully temporarily) onto the Naughty List were moved because they did not listen to what their Mummy or Daddy said, and instead ignored them and did what they wanted to. Sometimes, your Mummy and / or Daddy know what's best for you, so it's a sure-fire way of staying on the Nice List if you listen to them.
2. BEING SELFISH
We can all be selfish at times, but those girls and boys who were the most selfish quickly found themselves on the Naughty List. Remember, it's always good to think of others before you do something...
3. FORGETTING THEIR MANNERS
It's hard being polite all the time, but Santa understands that it's normal to forget every now-and-then. However, those boys and girls who stopped using their "please" and "thanks yous" soon found themselves off the Nice List and onto the Naughty List.
DON'T WORRY, THERE'S STILL TIME!
If you've seen your name on the Naughty List and you are worried that you'll miss out on Santa's presents come Christmas Day, then don't worry. There is plenty of time to be as nice as you can be and earn your way back onto the Nice List. Whilst you may not know when us Elves have been, we've got amazing memories so if we notice you have been nice, then we'll be sure to let Santa know so he can put you back on the Nice List, so be good!

As we edge closer to Christmas, the letters to Santa start to flood in from all the boys and girls around the world - it certainly keeps the North Pole's Postal Service on their toes with all the additional mail!
I do love reading all the letters, and learning about what toys are trending, as this certainly helps ensure the Elves in Santa's Workshop plan their production runs in the build up to Christmas Day. It's also wonderful learning just a little bit more about all the boys and girls who write in - did you know that green is quite a popular colour this year?
It always makes everybody at The North Pole so happy knowing that every girl and boy is thinking of them at this time of year, and certainly helps keep us full of festive cheer as we busily prepare for Santa's epic journey on Christmas Eve.

If you're reading this and haven't gotten round to sending us your letter, don't worry. Thanks to the magic of the North Pole's Postal Service, you can post your letter right up until the 23rd of December and it will still reach us in time.

Around this time of year, I start to receive lots of letters from boys and girls asking me how they can be sure they'll be on my Nice List before I set off to deliver Christmas presents all over the world.
Well, I thought I would share my top tips for being nice and to ensure you don't end up on my Naughty List for Christmas.
ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH
Nobody likes a liar, especially Santa. Lying is something naughty people do and it liars are people that cannot be trusted. So no matter how difficult it might be, or what might happen, always tell the truth - especially to your mummy and daddy. It's always better to tell the truth than become a liar.
TREAT OTHERS HOW YOU WANT TO BE TREATED
There's nothing worse than being friends with someone who is a meanie. Like somebody who takes your favourite Hot Wheels Car or your Barbie doll off you, especially without asking first. If you are nice to ther people, they will be nice to you.
BE POLITE
It's amazing what a difference being polite can make. Boys and girls who say "please" and "thank you" are always going to end up on the Nice List. Being rude, however, is a sure fire way of making it straight to my Naughty List! So remember to be polite wherever you can.
HELP OTHERS
Do you remember when you couldn't climb across the balance beam in the park without help? Or when you got upset when going to school? Well when that happened, your mummy or daddy were probably there to help you when things got tough, so why don't you think about how you could help somebody else too? Maybe when you see somebody following behind you through a door, you could hold it open for them? Or if you see somebody struggling to carry a heavy bag, maybe you could help them?
OVER TO YOU
At the end of the day, some people are nice and some people are naughty. Which one do you want to be? I know which ones I prefer...

When you are famous for having a bright red nose, it is vitally important to ensure that you do not lose the shine. But how does Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer ensure he does not become Rudolph the Reindeer?
Well, the first thing that I do is to eat all my vegetables at meal times. All those vitamins do wonders for keeping my nose a brighter shade of red! I particularly love a good crunchy carrot, especially when left by all the nice boys and girls on Christmas Eve - leading the most famous sleigh in the world is hungry work!
I also like to keep in shape and often play outside with the other Reindeer, which helps keep me fit and healthy. You cannot beat the fresh air of playing outside, particularly around the North Pole!
Oh and one other thing... being kind and helpful is also a great way of helping keep my nose bright because when I'm helping others and being nice, I feel good myself and when I feel good, my nose shines the brightest!
So there you go, no magic potions, just eating healthily, staying active and being kind is what it takes to keep me Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.

All year, the elves and I have been busy trying out new gift wrapping ideas and practicing so that we'll be ready for Christmas. Last year we wrapped precisely 1,701,426,340 (that's one billion, seven-hundred and one million, four-hundred and twenty-six thousand, three-hundred and forty) presents for all the boys and girls on The Nice List (unfortunately, we could not wrap the lumps of coal that the boys and girls on The Naughty List received)!
Ensuring that we keep our gifts wrapped in fun and exciting ways means we've all been busy studying "The Science of Gift Wrapping" and "Advanced Taping Techniques" at Elf School during the spring and summer. I've also been keeping tabs on social media (with Gifterest and Tapebook being personal favourites of mine - follow me via @BuddyWrapsOfficial) for some cool and inspiring designs!
That reminds me... I must check that Mrs Claus has managed to place our order for this year's wrapping paper, gift tags and bucket loads of sticky tape!

Ho, ho ho! It won't be long until I'm flying around the world at lightning speed, delivering Christmas presents to all the girls and boys on The Nice List. But before I do, The Sleigh needs to have its annual service to ensure it doesn't break down during my trip!
I'm also excited because The Sleigh's satnav is due an upgrade to the new ElfElf Go 900 which gives me live traffic updates and marks all the homes of girls and boys on The Nice List with a smiley face, so I know where to stop on my busy night.
Hopefully the elves in the workshop will manage to fix my heated seat too, because it got a bit chilly at times last year!

As the big day edges ever closer, I just don't have the time to visit every boy and girl on Earth, so I rely on my army of Elven helpers to check-in on everybody for me.
Over the next few weeks, I have asked the Elves to wait until bedtime and then stop by all the boys and girls whilst they're sleeping to see if they have been naughty or nice recently.
Those little Elves have magical sense and can tell whether a boy or girl has been naughty or nice whilst they sleep - it saves me so much time this time of year!
Unfortunately, a few boys and girls have been really naughty recently so will need to ensure they try their hardest to be as nice as possible to get back on the nice list. Luckily, there is still plenty of time to go until I set off on my Christmas delivery run!

See if you've made the Nice List or Naughty List!

Santa is such a great boss - he always looks after us Elves and gives us great benefits. This week, I got a bonus for painting 102,209,282,387 wooden blocks in forest green without so much as a hiccup. I cannot wait for my bag of chocolate coins to arrive tomorrow morning!
Oh, that reminds me. I need to speak to our Head of Toy Cars, Claude, to make sure we've got plenty of wheels and flame stickers for all those Hot Wheels cars we'll need to make ready for Santa's big trip on Christmas Eve...

I've lost count as to how many times that big red suit has been washed over the years... Whilst Santa is busy planning his deliveries for Christmas Day, I like to help ensure he looks his best for the big day. But keeping a bright red suit clean, without fading, is trickier than it looks!
Back in the day, I used to hand-wash Santa's suit in the bathtub, using only soap and water, but due to its delicate nature, I had to be really careful not to damage it and it would often take me a good part of the day to do it properly.
Thankfully, Buddy (the Elf) shared a secret tip with me... Don't tell him I've shared this, but if you use a sprinkle of glitter and add a drop of Christmas essence from elf's workshop, the suit comes out looking like new!
Now, I'd better get the washing on ready for Santa's next delivery run!

Last Christmas, the other reindeer and I set our best time when it came to making a round trip across the world, cutting 17.3 seconds off our previous best set in 1983.
For Christmas 2022, we're aiming to go one step further and go even faster but as with all top sleigh-leading reindeer, you have to stay in shape! Yes, even I - Rudolph - has to train to ensure I'm up to the job of leading Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve.
Thanks to advances in technology and breakthroughs in Reindeer Exercise and Physiology, I've been focusing on my stride length to eek a little more out of each prance - even a couple of centimetres per prance soon adds up and makes the difference.
And with my latest Antler Strap Pro, I've been able to keep an eye on my magic reserves to ensure I never push faster than my stores can replenish, meaning I can maintain maximum speed all whilst lighting the way with my shiny red nose.
Now if I can just convince Dasher to cut down on the mince pies, I reckon we'll be set for another record-breaking delivery this Christmas Eve...
